## Detecting Mouse Location Using JavaScript

I created this simple HTML page with a customized JavaScript feature that allows a `<div>` element to follow the mouse cursor or clicking point on mobile devices. 

A `<div>` element with the text 'intoCODE' is positioned initially in the middle of the page. As the user moves the mouse, it dynamically adjusts its position to match the cursor's location.

Additionally, the code determines the direction in which the mouse is moving relative to the `<div>` element. It updates a separate element with the corresponding direction information, such as 'Going left,' 'Going right,' 'Going up,' 'Going down,' and their combinations ('up left,' 'up right,' 'down left,' 'down right').

Skills I gained:
    * detecting the position of an element on a web page
    * accessing the mouse coordinates
    * updating the position of an element dynamically
