## Detect Screen Rotation Using JavaScript

I created this HTML page with a JavaScript feature which detects the screen orientation and updates the background color and the text accordingly.

Skills I gained:
  * event handling using the addEventListener method
  * detecting device orientation
  * accessing and modifying the contents and styling of an element.
  
Here is the [live demo](https://detect-screen-rotation-js.netlify.app/).
