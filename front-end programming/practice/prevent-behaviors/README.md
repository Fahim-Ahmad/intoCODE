## Preventing Default Behaviors with JavaScript

I have created this sample HTML page customized with JavaScript code that prevents certain default behaviors for specific elements. 

The JavaScript targets elements with the class "prevent-behavior" and applies different preventions based on their additional class names. For example, elements with the class "prevent-paste" will have the paste event disabled, and if someone tries to paste text into that input, an alert will notify the user that it's not allowed.

Skills I gained:
  * event Handling
  * conditional Logic
  * loops
