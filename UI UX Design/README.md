# Main Puspose:
Designing an app to enable individuals to conveniently interact with different institutions and government offices. By incorporating a dynamic interface, users will be able to access contact information, schedule appointments, and submit documents effortlessly. By providing a comprehensive solution within a centralized platform, users will be able to streamline their interactions with different institutions.

## Key Features:

1. User Authentication:
   - To ensure secure access, every user will be required to create an account and log in. This will guarantee the privacy and security of the data.

2. Dynamic Interface:
   - The app will feature a dynamic interface that adapts to the user's selection. For instance:
     - When users choose a list of universities, they will be presented with the <u>contact information and addresses</u> of the selected university.
     - When users select hospitals, they will have access to <u>contact details, addresses</u>, as well as the option to <u>schedule appointments</u>.
     - Similarly, when users choose government offices, they will be able to view <u>contact information, addresses</u>, <u>schedule appointments</u>, and conveniently <u>submit their documents</u>.


I have designed a sample app featuring the aforementioned criteria using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). To explore the detailed design and interact with the prototype, you can access it through the following links:

## Detailed Features:

1. User Account Creation:
   - Upon downloading the app, users will be able to create an account by providing necessary information, including an email address for receiving a confirmation code. Once the code is entered correctly, users will receive a confirmation notification on the screen, indicating that their account has been successfully created.

3. Viewing Details:
   - Upon selecting a specific item, such as a government office, users will be presented with a list of different offices. They can then view the details of a particular office, including its address, contact number, email, etc. Additionally, users will have the option to make appointments or send documents.
