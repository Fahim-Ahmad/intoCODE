# About 
Throughout the Content Management System (CMS) course we acquired practical skills in creating WordPress themes.
During this class, we developed an example theme using YAML4, which resembles the design showcased below.

# Final project
As part of the final project, I have developed a functional WordPress theme from below design pattern that fulfills the following requirements:

> Design pattern -> [final_project -> grey_stairwell -> index.html](final_project/grey_stairwell/index.html)
        
- Verifying the above design template against the [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) validator to ensure its validity.

- Ensuring that all necessary styles from the `design template` and `personal styles/corrections` are being included in the `style.css` file.

- Developing fully functional template files, including `header.php`, `index.php`, `sidebar.php`, and `footer.php`.

- Including a correct screenshot.png and a template description for the dashboard.

- Ensuring the presence of the following working template files: `page.php`, `single.php`, `archive.php`, and `search.php`.

- Implementing a `dynamic sidebar` for widgets in the post-overview (`index.php`).

- Designing the `page.php` template file to display content without a sidebar, utilizing the full width of the page.

- Adding a visible footer navigation menu in the footer section of the website, which differs from the main navigation menu in terms of menu items.

- Configuring the post-overview (`index.php`) to display the three most recent posts and enabling pagination for navigating to posts 4 and onwards. The same pagination functionality is applied to the search results page (`search.php`).

- Ensuring that the post-overview (`index.php`) displays tags along with categories for each post.

- Creating a dropdown main menu that reveals subpages of a parent page upon mouse hover.

- Furthermore, the project included the installation of the `Contact Form 7` plugin, enabling the creation of a contact form with multiple fields as well as creating of a `breadcrumb menu` integrated into the `page.php` and `single.php` template files, enhancing navigation throughout the website.

The complete theme files and documentation can be found in [final_project -> grey_stairwell](https://github.com/Fahim-Ahmad/intoCODE/tree/main/Content%20Management%20System/final_project/grey_stairwell). Contributions for further improvement or utilization in other projects are welcome.
